# Quotable

Simple Vite React TypeScript CRUD app with free API (https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).

## How it works

- If the list of quotes is empty when the page is loaded, it fetches five random quotes from the API
- Handles CRUD operations (user can add quotes to a list, read the list of quotes, edit existing quotes, delete quotes)
- Subpage that allows the user to fetch and display a random quote
